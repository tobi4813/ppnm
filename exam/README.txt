A: Implement the Berrut B1 rational function interpolation algorithm and its derivative
B: Implement the Berrut B2 rational function interpolation algorithm and its derivative
C: Verify the operation time of B1 goes as O(n) (although this is expected because it's just a for-loop with n iterations) 

So I give myself 10 points (:
